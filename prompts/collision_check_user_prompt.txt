**Task:**

Analyze whether executing this step will cause ANY collision (gripper-to-object, arm-to-object, or object-to-object).

Consider:
1. The gripper's physical dimensions and current orientation
2. The vertical approach path from above for pick/place operations
3. Objects that might be in the way along the movement path
4. If holding an object, whether it will collide with other objects
5. Adequate clearance margins (at least 0.02m recommended)
