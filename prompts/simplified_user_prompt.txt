## Instructions

Analyze the scene data above and generate a complete command sequence to accomplish the task. Remember to:

1. Check object spacing on X and Y axes against gripper width (0.1m default, 0.05m rotated)
2. Use `rotate_gripper_90()` when neighbors are within 0.05m on Y-axis in default orientation
3. Unstack objects from top-down if they block access
4. Use temporary placements with adequate clearance (>0.1m from other objects)
5. Ensure all ground placements use z=0
6. Follow logical sequence: pick_up before place
